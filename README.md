## Getting Started

First, install dependencies.

Since this project uses Next 15 and React 19 RC, to avoid conflicts with dependencies, you will need to install it with the `--force` flag.

```bash
npm i --force
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
